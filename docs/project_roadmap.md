# Ames Housing Data Analysis Project Roadmap

## 1. Project Definition

### Objectives
- Predict house sale prices in Ames, Iowa using advanced deep learning techniques.
- Identify the most influential factors affecting house prices to inform real estate professionals and city planners.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to explore predictions and insights.
- Define a clear project timeline, outlining major phases such as data preparation, modeling, analysis, and delivery, to ensure steady progress and timely completion.

### Stakeholders

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- **Real Estate Professionals:** Use model predictions and feature importance to advise clients, set pricing strategies, and negotiate sales.
- **Appraisers:** Leverage data-driven valuations to support property appraisals and ensure accuracy.
- **Investors/Property Managers:** Use predictions and key drivers to inform investment decisions, property acquisitions, and management strategies.
- **Home Buyers/Sellers:** Benefit from transparent price predictions and understanding what features add value to a home.

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
- **City Planners/Officials:** Use insights to inform urban planning, zoning, and policy decisions.
- **Developers:** Assess which property features and locations are most desirable for new construction or renovation.
- **Mortgage/Insurance Companies:** Refine risk assessment models using predictive insights, though may require additional data.
- **Local Businesses:** Use neighborhood trends and predictions to inform business location and marketing strategies.
- **Advocacy Groups:** Leverage findings to support affordable housing initiatives and community advocacy.
- **Academic Researchers:** Use data and models for further research in urban studies, economics, or machine learning.

### Success Metrics (Examples)
- Achieve a root mean squared error (RMSE) below a defined threshold (e.g., RMSE < $20,000).
- Deliver a dashboard with at least three interactive features (e.g., filter by neighborhood, visualize feature importance, compare predictions).
- Positive feedback from at least 80% of surveyed stakeholders.

## 2. Data Acquisition & Preparation

- Obtain the Ames Housing dataset from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle).
- Assess data quality and completeness.
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, outliers, encoding, etc.).
    - *Example:* Impute missing 'LotFrontage' values using the median by neighborhood.
- Document all data preparation steps.

---

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze distributions and relationships of key variables.
    - *Example:* Visualize the relationship between 'OverallQual' and 'SalePrice'.
- Identify and handle outliers.
    - *Example:* Flag properties with unusually large 'GrLivArea' for review.
- Summarize findings for stakeholders.

---

## 4. Modeling & Prediction

- Select and implement deep learning model(s) for price prediction.
    - *Example:* Train a neural network with three hidden layers.
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Evaluate model performance (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
- Interpret model results and variable importance.
    - *Example:* Use SHAP values to explain feature importance.

---

## 5. Interpretation & Insights

- Analyze and visualize feature importance.
    - *Example:* 'Neighborhood', 'OverallQual', and 'TotalBsmtSF' are top predictors.
- Extract actionable insights for stakeholders.
    - *Example:* Homes near parks command a 10% premium.
- Assess model fairness and potential biases.

---

## 6. Dashboard & Visualization

- Design and build an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
    - *Example:* Allow users to select a property and see predicted price, key features, and comparable sales.
- Integrate key metrics, predictions, and visualizations.
- Ensure usability and accessibility.

---

## 7. Reporting & Presentation

- Prepare a comprehensive project report.
- Create presentation slides for stakeholders.
- Highlight key findings, recommendations, and next steps.

---

## 8. Project Management

- Set timeline and milestones for each phase.
    - *Example:* Complete EDA by March 15.
- Assign responsibilities and resources.
- Schedule regular check-ins and updates.
- Identify and mitigate risks.
    - *Example:* Data quality issues may delay modeling phase.

---

## 9. Delivery & Feedback

- Deliver final products (dashboard, report, presentation).
- Gather feedback from stakeholders (e.g., surveys, meetings).
- Plan for future improvements or follow-up projects.
