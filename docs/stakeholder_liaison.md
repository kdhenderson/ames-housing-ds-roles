# Stakeholder Liaison Role â€“ Ames Housing Analysis

## Role Overview
The Stakeholder Liaison serves as a bridge between business/subject matter experts (SMEs) and technical teams. This role ensures that the technical work aligns with business needs and that stakeholders understand the project's technical aspects, deliverables, and limitations.

The liaison is often deeply involved in helping stakeholders clarify and define project objectives. Stakeholders may have broad or high-level goals, and the liaison works to translate these into specific, actionable objectives that are both valuable and technically feasible.

## Key Responsibilities
- Gather and translate business requirements into actionable tasks for technical teams
- Communicate project goals, progress, and limitations to stakeholders in accessible language
- Facilitate meetings and ongoing communication between business and technical teams
- Collect, organize, and relay stakeholder feedback to the project manager and technical team
- Support the project manager in prioritizing stakeholder needs and managing expectations
- Maintain documentation of requirements, decisions, and changes throughout the project
- Assist with user training and, when needed, post-project support for business users

## Required Skills & Knowledge
- Strong communication and interpersonal skills
- Ability to understand and translate between business and technical perspectives
- Basic knowledge of data science concepts, analytics, and modeling (no need for deep technical expertise)
- Empathy and active listening
- Organizational and project management support skills
- Problem-solving and conflict resolution abilities

## Typical Interactions
- **Business Stakeholders:** Real estate professionals, appraisers, investors/property managers, and other primary business users
- **Technical Teams:** Data scientists, analysts, engineers, and developers
- **Project Manager:** Regular collaboration to ensure alignment and progress
- **Other Stakeholders:** May interact with city planners, developers, and secondary users as needed 

## Example in Practice

**Scenario:**  
The technical team is ready to build the dashboard for real estate professionals and appraisers, but needs to know which features and visualizations are most important to include.

**Step-by-Step Example:**

**A. Pre-Meeting Preparation**
- The liaison gathers initial requirements from previous discussions and reviews any documentation.
- Prepares a list of possible dashboard features (e.g., price prediction, feature importance, neighborhood comparisons).

**B. Stakeholder Meeting (Liaison + Real Estate Professionals + Appraisers)**
- **Liaison:** "We're ready to design the dashboard. What are the most important questions you want to answer with this tool?"
- **Stakeholder:** "We want to quickly see a price estimate for a property, and understand which features are driving that estimate."
- **Liaison:** "Would it be helpful to compare properties across neighborhoods, or see trends over time?"
- **Stakeholder:** "Yes, neighborhood comparisons would be great. Trends are less important for us."

**C. Internal Technical Team Meeting (Liaison + Data Scientists + PM)**
- **Liaison:** "Stakeholders want a dashboard that shows price predictions, highlights the top 5 features influencing each prediction, and allows comparison across neighborhoods."
- **Data Scientist:** "We can use SHAP values for feature importance. We'll need to ensure the dashboard can display these interactively."
- **PM:** "Let's set a milestone for a dashboard prototype in two weeks."

**D. Follow-Up Communication**
- **Liaison to Stakeholders:** "The technical team will build a prototype with the features you requested. We'll schedule a review session in two weeks for your feedback."
- **Liaison to Technical Team:** "Please prioritize the interactive feature importance and neighborhood comparison tools."

**E. Review Meeting (All Parties)**
- **Liaison:** Facilitates the demo, ensures stakeholders' questions are addressed, and gathers feedback for the next iteration.

**Types of Communication Involved:**
- Clarifying needs: Turning broad requests into specific, actionable requirements.
- Translating language: Explaining technical concepts (e.g., "feature importance") in business terms.
- Managing expectations: Outlining what's feasible and what trade-offs exist.
- Feedback loop: Ensuring stakeholder feedback is heard, understood, and acted upon.
- Documentation: Summarizing decisions and next steps for all parties.

> **Note:**  
> The Stakeholder Liaison role is most common in medium to large projects with multiple stakeholder groups or high technical complexity. In smaller projects, the project manager or technical lead may fulfill this function.
